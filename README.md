WordpressClient is a very simple client for the Wordpress [REST API][api].

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/hemnet/wordpress_client.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/hemnet/wordpress_client) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/repos/5645938269568041da00cded/badges/5e870b57428f23c1f2ff/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/repos/5645938269568041da00cded/feed) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/wordpress_client.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/wordpress_client)

## Usage

**[Read the full API documentation][docs]**

Initialize a client with a user name, password and API URL. You can then search
for posts.

```ruby
client = WordpressClient.new(
  url: "https://example.com/wp-json/",
  username: "example",
  password: "example",
)

client.posts(per_page: 5) # => [WordpressClient::Post, WordpressClient::Post]
```

### Creating a post

You can create posts by calling `create_post`.

```ruby
data = {
  author: "Name",
  # ...
}

post = client.create_post(data) # => WordpressClient::Post
updated_post = client.update_post(post.id, title: "Updated") # => WordpressClient::Post

updated_post.author # => "Name"
updated_post.title_html # => "Updated"
```

## Running tests

You need to install Docker and set it up for your machine.

Run tests using the normal `rspec` command after installing all bundles.

```
bundle exec rspec
```

You can also run `bundle exec guard` to have tests run automatically when you
change files in the repo. If you tag your examples with `focus: true`, Guard
will only run those tests. This can help when doing very focused coding, but
remember to remove the filter before you commit and let the entire suite run.

```ruby
describe Foo, focus: true do
  # ...
end
```

The normal `rspec` command will *not* use this filter in case it is ever
committed accidentally, so CI can catch any problems.

## Releasing a new version

The normal gem release cycle works using `rake release`.

If you make changes to the docker image, you can release it using `rake
docker:release`.
